Let me do a final analysis of the updated portfolio:\n\n**Updated Portfolio Summary:**\n\n**Trades Executed:**\n1. Sold 3 shares of KHC (reduced from 7 to 4 shares)\n2. Sold 3 shares of GILD (reduced from 7 to 4 shares)  \n3. Sold 1 share of FAST (reduced from 3 to 2 shares)\n4. Bought 1 share of MSFT (increased from 1 to 2 shares)\n5. Bought 1 share of NVDA (increased from 4 to 5 shares)\n\n**Portfolio Changes:**\n- Increased exposure to high-growth tech leaders (MSFT, NVDA)\n- Reduced overweight positions in healthcare (GILD) and consumer staples (KHC)\n- Maintained cash at reasonable level ($69.31) for future opportunities\n- Portfolio remains diversified across technology, consumer staples, healthcare, and industrials\n\n**Rationale:**\n1. **MSFT and NVDA**: Both are leaders in AI and cloud computing with strong growth prospects\n2. **GILD reduction**: Healthcare stock with slower growth profile, was overweight at 7.6%\n3. **KHC reduction**: Consumer staples with limited growth potential\n4. **FAST reduction**: Smaller position to raise cash\n\nThe portfolio is now better positioned with increased weight in high-growth technology leaders while maintaining diversification. The cash position is minimal but sufficient for small adjustments if opportunities arise.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
