{"signature": "deepseek-v3", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Now let me check the updated portfolio composition. The rebalancing strategy I've implemented:\n1. Reduced exposure to high-flying tech stocks (sold 2 NVDA, sold 1 MSFT)\n2. Increased defensive positions (added 2 AEP, 2 XEL, 2 PEP, 1 GILD)\n3. Maintained a reasonable cash position for flexibility\n\nThis creates a more balanced portfolio with:\n- Tech: NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN, META, PLTR, AMD (reduced weight)\n- Consumer Staples: COST, PEP, MDLZ (increased)\n- Healthcare: AZN, AMGN, GILD (increased)\n- Utilities: AEP, XEL (increased)\n- Telecom: TMUS\n- Cash: ~$87.74\n\nThe portfolio now has better diversification across sectors and is less concentrated in tech, which should provide better risk-adjusted returns.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
