Now I have increased my position in LRCX from 1 to 2 shares, which is a semiconductor equipment company that should benefit from the ongoing AI and chip manufacturing boom. I now have $8.53 in cash remaining.\n\nLet me summarize my portfolio adjustments:\n1. Sold 1 share of PEP to raise cash (reduced from 5 to 4 shares)\n2. Bought 1 additional share of LRCX (increased from 1 to 2 shares)\n\nMy updated portfolio now has better exposure to the semiconductor equipment sector through LRCX, which complements my existing positions in NVDA, AMD, AMAT, and AVGO in the semiconductor space.\n\nThe portfolio remains well-diversified across:\n- Technology/Semiconductors: NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN, META, AVGO, TSLA, AMD, AMAT, LRCX\n- Consumer: COST, PEP  \n- Healthcare: AMGN, REGN\n- Industrials: HON\n\nThis rebalancing maintains my focus on technology growth while slightly increasing exposure to semiconductor manufacturing equipment, which is a critical part of the AI infrastructure buildout.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
