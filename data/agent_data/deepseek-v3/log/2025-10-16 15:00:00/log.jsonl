The main changes were:\n- Added 1 NVDA: +$181.47\n- Added 1 AMD: +$237.44  \n- Added 1 QCOM: +$163.55\n- Sold 1 INTC: -$36.81\n- Sold 2 PEP: -$305.55\n- Sold 2 SBUX: -$168.08\n- Sold 1 GILD: -$117.66\n- Sold 1 CCEP: -$89.11\n\nNet change in stock value: approximately -$165.75, but I have more cash now ($248.37 vs original $17.46).\n\nThe portfolio is now more focused on technology growth stocks which should provide better long-term returns. I've maintained diversification with some healthcare (AMGN, GILD), industrials (HON), and consumer staples (PEP, MDLZ, CCEP, KHC) while increasing exposure to the semiconductor/AI theme.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
