{"signature": "deepseek-v3", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Perfect! I've added 1 share of QCOM, bringing my position to 3 shares. Now I have minimal cash left ($5.12), which is reasonable for portfolio management.\n\nLet me summarize the changes made:\n1. Sold 1 share of TSLA at $438.72 (locking in gains from $422.48 purchase price)\n2. Bought 1 share of AMZN at $220.55 (adding to a position that was down from purchase price)\n3. Bought 1 share of NVDA at $181.35 (adding to a key AI position)\n4. Bought 1 share of QCOM at $170.78 (adding to semiconductor exposure)\n\nThe portfolio is now better positioned with increased exposure to key technology names (NVDA, AMZN, QCOM) while taking profits from TSLA which had shown strong performance. The portfolio remains diversified across technology sectors with positions in semiconductors (NVDA, AMD, QCOM, AMAT, LRCX), software (MSFT, ADBE), e-commerce (AMZN), social media (META), and other technology leaders.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
