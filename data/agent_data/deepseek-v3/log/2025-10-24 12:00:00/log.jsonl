Now let me summarize the portfolio rebalancing I've done:\n\n## Portfolio Analysis and Rebalancing Summary\n\n**Original Portfolio (before adjustments):**\n- Total Value: $10,566.34\n- Cash: $130.14 (1.23% of portfolio)\n- 20 different stock positions\n- Heavily concentrated in technology stocks\n\n**Problems Identified:**\n1. **Over-concentration in tech**: Too many semiconductor and software stocks\n2. **Too many small positions**: Several positions with only 1 share\n3. **Insufficient cash**: Only 1.23% cash limits flexibility\n4. **Lack of diversification**: Missing exposure to other sectors\n\n**Actions Taken:**\n\n**Sold Positions (to raise cash and reduce concentration):**\n1. GILD (1 share) - biotech\n2. AMGN (1 share) - biotech  \n3. ADBE (1 share) - software\n4. ON (2 shares) - semiconductors\n5. PANW (1 share) - cybersecurity\n6. REGN (1 share) - biotech\n7. LRCX (1 share) - semiconductor equipment\n8. AEP (1 share reduced from 3 to 2) - utilities\n9. QCOM (2 shares reduced from 5 to 3) - semiconductors\n10. AMAT (1 share reduced from 2 to 1) - semiconductor equipment\n\n**New Positions Added (for diversification):**\n1. COST (1 share) - defensive retail, consumer staples\n2. TSLA (1 share) - electric vehicles, growth\n3. NFLX (1 share) - streaming/media\n4.
