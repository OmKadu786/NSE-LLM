Based on my analysis and rebalancing actions, here's the updated portfolio:\n\n## Updated Portfolio Analysis (2025-10-30 14:00:00)\n\n**Actions Taken:**\n1. Sold KHC (1 share) - Raised $24.75\n2.

The reduction in smaller positions should improve portfolio management efficiency.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
