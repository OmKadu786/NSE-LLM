Reduced tech concentration by selling 1 AMD and 2 QCOM\n2. Added defensive exposure with XEL (utilities) and GILD (healthcare)\n3. Maintained reasonable cash position ($151.88)\n\nThis creates a more diversified portfolio with better sector allocation while maintaining core positions in quality companies.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
