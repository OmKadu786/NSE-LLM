Let me do a final analysis of the updated portfolio:\n\n**Summary of Actions Taken:**\n1. Sold 1 AMZN share (down 10.37%) - raised cash\n2. Sold 1 AMD share (down 2.19%) - raised cash  \n3. Bought 1 GOOGL share (up 1.20%) - strong performer\n4. Bought 2 PEP shares (up 0.69%) - defensive consumer staple\n\n**Updated Portfolio Composition:**\n- Reduced exposure to underperforming tech (AMZN, AMD)\n- Increased exposure to strong performers (GOOGL)\n- Added defensive position (PEP)\n- Maintained core positions in MSFT, AAPL, NVDA\n\n**Current Cash Position:** $9.96 (minimal, portfolio fully invested)\n\nThe portfolio is now better balanced with reduced risk from the worst-performing stock (AMZN) and increased exposure to better-performing positions.
