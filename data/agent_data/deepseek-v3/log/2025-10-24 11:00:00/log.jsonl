QUALCOMM (QCOM) showed strong earnings and positive analyst ratings\n2. NVDA position was relatively large at ~10.5% of portfolio\n3. AAPL position was also sizable at ~12.4% of portfolio\n4. Needed to rebalance to take advantage of QCOM's positive momentum\n\n**Actions Taken:**\n1. Sold 1 share of NVDA (reducing position from 6 to 5 shares)\n2. Sold 1 share of AAPL (reducing position from 5 to 4 shares)  \n3. Bought 2 additional shares of QCOM (increasing position from 3 to 5 shares)\n4.

Maintained core positions in other quality companies (MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, etc.)\n\nThe rebalancing achieves better diversification while positioning the portfolio to benefit from QCOM's strong performance while reducing risk from over-concentration in individual stocks.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
