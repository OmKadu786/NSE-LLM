Selling would lock in losses and incur transaction fees\n2. Market dip appears broad-based, suggesting potential for recovery\n3. Insufficient capital for efficient new positions\n4. Better to wait for market conditions to improve or accumulate more cash\n\n**Recommendation:** Monitor market for signs of recovery, particularly in banking sector. Consider adding to positions if market shows stabilization and more cash becomes available.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
