{"signature": "nse-sniper-hourly-v1", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "TITAN: ₹3,647.8 → ₹3,690.6 (+1.17%)\n\nThe strongest movers appear to be JSWSTEEL (+1.43%), HINDALCO (+1.22%), and TITAN (+1.17%). However, with only ₹691.21 in cash, I can't buy meaningful positions in these stocks.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n1. Current ICICIBANK position has a small unrealized gain of ₹32.00\n2. Selling would incur ₹22.00 in fees, leaving only ₹10.00 net gain\n3. No better buying opportunities with limited cash\n4. No negative news or catalysts that would suggest immediate selling\n\n**Decision: HOLD ICICIBANK position**\n\nThe small gain doesn't justify the transaction costs, and holding allows us to potentially benefit from further upside in banking stocks. The market appears to be showing strength in metals/steel and consumer discretionary sectors, but we lack sufficient capital to reposition.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
