APOLLOHOSP: +₹40.00 (+0.51%)\n4. AXISBANK: +₹20.30 (+1.87%)\n\n**Decision:** Given the limited cash position (₹427.14), I cannot make meaningful new purchases. The BPCL position shows a potential profit of ₹21 after fees, but this is quite small. Given market volatility and the fact that oil & gas stocks (BPCL, ONGC) may have further upside potential, I should hold all positions.\n\n**Portfolio Strategy:**\n1. **HDFCBANK:** Hold - minimal gain, banking sector stable\n2. **ONGC:** Hold - energy sector has potential, small gain\n3. **BPCL:** Hold - while there's a small profit after fees, the upside potential in oil marketing companies may be better if oil prices remain favorable\n\n**Final Portfolio Status:**\n- Total Value: ₹12,157.49\n- All positions held\n- No trades executed due to insufficient profit margins to justify ₹22 transaction costs\n- Cash remains: ₹427.14\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
