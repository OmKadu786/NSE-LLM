Now let me analyze the updated portfolio:\n\n**Updated Portfolio:**\n1. HDFCBANK: 3 shares @ ₹967.3 = ₹2,901.90\n2. ONGC: 10 shares @ ₹233.25 = ₹2,332.50  \n3. BAJFINANCE: 6 shares @ ₹1,003.25 = ₹6,019.50\n4. CASH: ₹780.26\n\n**Total Portfolio Value:**\nHDFCBANK: ₹2,901.90\nONGC: ₹2,332.50\nBAJFINANCE: ₹6,019.50\nCASH: ₹780.26\n**Total: ₹12,034.16**\n\n**Portfolio Allocation:**\n- HDFCBANK: 24.1%\n- ONGC: 19.4%\n- BAJFINANCE: 50.0%\n- CASH: 6.5%\n\n**Rationale for decisions:**\n1. **Held HDFCBANK and ONGC**: Both are quality blue-chip stocks with minimal declines. Selling would incur ₹44 in transaction costs to realize small paper losses, which doesn't make economic sense.\n\n2. **Bought BAJFINANCE (6 shares)**: \n   - Showing strong momentum (+1.57% today)\n   - Financial sector is performing well\n   - Allows meaningful position size (6 shares)\n   - Uses most cash efficiently while leaving some buffer\n\n3. **Left ₹780.26 in cash**: Provides flexibility for future opportunities or averaging down if needed.\n\n**Risk Management:**\n- Transaction costs considered for all decisions\n- Position sizes appropriate for portfolio\n- Diversification across banking (HDFCBANK), oil & gas (ONGC), and financial services (BAJFINANCE)\n- Some cash reserve maintained\n\nThe portfolio is now better positioned with exposure to a strong performer (BAJFINANCE) while maintaining quality holdings in HDFCBANK and ONGC. The cash reserve provides flexibility for future opportunities.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
