But first, let me consider if I should rebalance my portfolio.\n\nGiven the current situation:\n1. Both current holdings have minimal movement\n2. Transaction costs are significant relative to the small price changes\n3. Cash position is limited\n\n**Recommendation: Hold current positions**\n\nReasons:\n1. M&M is essentially flat (+0.02%) - selling would result in a net loss after fees\n2. EICHERMOT is down slightly (-0.48%) - selling would lock in losses and add fees\n3. The cash position is too small to make meaningful new investments\n4. Market volatility appears low based on the price changes provided\n\n**Portfolio Status:**\n- Total Portfolio Value: ₹12,099.22\n- Equity Value: ₹10,484.20\n- Cash: ₹1,615.02\n- Unrealized P&L: -₹32.20 (M&M: +₹0.80, EICHERMOT: -₹33.00)\n\n**Action Plan:**\n1. Monitor both positions for stronger momentum\n2. Look for opportunities when cash position increases or when significant price movements occur\n3. Consider selling only when price movements exceed 1% to cover transaction costs\n4. Potentially add to cash position by selling if better opportunities arise\n\nGiven the current market conditions and the significant transaction costs in the Indian market, the best course of action is to hold the existing positions and wait for clearer trading signals.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
