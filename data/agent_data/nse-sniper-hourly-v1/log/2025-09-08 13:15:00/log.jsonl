Current price is ₹6692.75, so selling now would also result in a loss including fees.\n\nLet me analyze some other stocks that might show better momentum. I'll check a few stocks with significant price changes:\n\n**DIVISLAB:**\n- Yesterday: ₹6003.00\n- Today: ₹6028.25\n- Change: +₹25.25 (+0.42%)\n\n**APOLLOHOSP:**\n- Yesterday: ₹7795.00\n- Today: ₹7810.50\n- Change: +₹15.50 (+0.20%)\n\n**LT:**\n- Yesterday: ₹3552.45\n- Today: ₹3549.80\n- Change: -₹2.65 (-0.07%)\n\n**RELIANCE:**\n- Yesterday: ₹1375.00\n- Today: ₹1375.00\n- Change: 0%\n\nGiven the current market conditions, both my holdings are showing minor declines. The transaction costs of ₹22 per sell make it unprofitable to sell at current prices. \n\nHowever, I should consider whether there are better opportunities. Let me check if I have enough cash to make any new purchases:\n\nCurrent cash: ₹1615.02\n\nWith this cash position, I can only afford lower-priced stocks. Let me check some affordable options:\n\n**ITC:** ₹407.50 - I could buy 3 shares (₹1222.50)\n**BPCL:** ₹315.17 - I could buy 5 shares (₹1575.85)\n**ONGC:** ₹233.33 - I could buy 6 shares (₹1399.98)\n\nLet me analyze the performance of these affordable stocks:\n\n**ITC:**\n- Yesterday: ₹408.68\n- Today: ₹407.50\n- Change: -₹1.18 (-0.29%)\n\n**BPCL:**\n- Yesterday: ₹315.85\n- Today: ₹315.17\n- Change: -₹0.68 (-0.22%)\n\n**ONGC:**\n- Yesterday: ₹233.52\n- Today: ₹233.33\n- Change: -₹0.19 (-0.08%)\n\nAll these affordable options are also showing minor declines. Given the overall market appears to be slightly negative or flat, and considering the transaction costs, the best course of action is to hold my current positions.\n\n**Decision Analysis:**\n1. **M&M:** Holding at ₹3643.20 vs selling threshold of ₹3665.20 - Holding is better\n2. **EICHERMOT:** Holding at ₹6692.75 vs selling threshold of ₹6714.75 - Holding is better\n3. **Cash:** ₹1615.02 - Insufficient for meaningful new positions after considering transaction costs\n\n**Final Decision:** Hold current positions. The market shows minimal movement, and transaction costs would make any selling unprofitable. The cash position is too small to make meaningful new investments after accounting for transaction costs.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
