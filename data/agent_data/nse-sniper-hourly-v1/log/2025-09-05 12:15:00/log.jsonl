{"signature": "nse-sniper-hourly-v1", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Given the constraints and the fact that both my current holdings are showing positive momentum (1.38% and 1.23% gains), I should consider holding them. However, let me think about the risk-reward:\n\n**Decision Framework:**\n1. Current holdings are profitable\n2. Transaction costs are significant relative to profits (₹44 fees vs ₹127.15 profit)\n3. Market seems to be generally positive based on price increases across most stocks\n4. Limited cash means I can't make large new purchases\n\n**Recommendation:** Hold current positions. The gains are reasonable, and selling would incur transaction costs that eat into profits. The market appears to be in a positive trend, so holding quality stocks like M&M (automotive) and EICHERMOT (premium motorcycles) makes sense.\n\nHowever, let me check if there are any specific catalysts or news that might change this decision. Since I can't access news directly, I'll make a conservative decision to hold.\n\n**Final Decision:** Hold M&M and EICHERMOT positions. Monitor for better opportunities but don't incur transaction costs unnecessarily.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
