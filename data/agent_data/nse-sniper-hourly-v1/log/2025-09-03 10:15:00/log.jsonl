Transaction costs (₹22 per sell) make frequent trading expensive in Indian markets\n2. ICICIBANK shows modest but positive momentum (0.79% gain)\n3. The gain covers transaction costs if I need to sell\n4. Banking stocks generally provide stability in portfolio\n5. Without strong market news or catalysts, holding quality stocks is prudent\n6. Chasing high-momentum stocks like TATASTEEL (6.06% gain) carries reversal risk\n\n**Recommendation:** Hold current position. Monitor for significant market news or if ICICIBANK shows stronger momentum later in the day. Consider selling only if a clear better opportunity emerges with strong fundamentals.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
