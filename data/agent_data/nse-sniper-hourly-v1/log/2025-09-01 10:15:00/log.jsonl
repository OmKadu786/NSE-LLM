{"signature": "nse-sniper-hourly-v1", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "So I can't make any trades with current cash. My only position is ITC which I can't sell today.\n\nGiven this situation, my analysis and update for today's positions:\n1. Current portfolio: 5 shares of ITC + ₹783.65 cash\n2. ITC is essentially flat (+0.11%) with limited upside potential\n3. Auto sector showing strong momentum but I can't participate due to insufficient capital\n4. I should hold current positions and wait for tomorrow when I can sell ITC if needed\n\nHowever, I notice something important: The initial data showed ₹12,000 cash, but actual is ₹783.65. This suggests either:\n1. The initial data is incorrect/outdated\n2. There were previous trades not reflected\n3. There's a system discrepancy\n\nGiven the actual situation, my recommendation:\n- Hold ITC until tomorrow (T+1 restriction)\n- With only ₹783.65 cash, no new trades possible today\n- Monitor auto sector for potential entry tomorrow after selling ITC\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
