{"signature": "nse-sniper-hourly-v1", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "4 shares of COALINDIA would be ₹1,573.00, which I can afford. But COALINDIA only showed +0.22% momentum, which is weak. Let me reconsider my strategy.\n\nActually, looking at my current portfolio:\n1. EICHERMOT: 1 share @ ₹6598.5 (high momentum +2.32%)\n2. M&M: 1 share @ ₹3577.8 (good momentum +1.90%)\n3. Cash: ₹1,615.02\n\nI have a reasonably diversified portfolio with two stocks showing good momentum. The cash position of ₹1,615.02 is too small to make meaningful additional purchases that meet the ₹2000 minimum transaction requirement.\n\n**Final Portfolio Analysis:**\n- **EICHERMOT**: Strong performer (+2.32%), worth holding\n- **M&M**: Good performer (+1.90%), adds diversification\n- **Cash**: ₹1,615.02 (can't make meaningful new purchases)\n\n**Recommendation:** Hold current positions. The portfolio is now better balanced with two momentum stocks instead of one flat stock (ITC) and one momentum stock. The cash can be kept as buffer or used when more capital accumulates.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
