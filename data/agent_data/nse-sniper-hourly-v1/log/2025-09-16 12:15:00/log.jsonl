The key consideration is that every sell transaction incurs ₹22 in fees.\n\n**Trade Analysis:**\n\n1. **KOTAKBANK**: +1.45% gain is the highest among all positions. However, with only 1 share, the absolute gain is ₹28.65. Selling would incur ₹22 fees, leaving only ₹6.65 profit. Not worth selling.\n\n2. **AXISBANK**: +0.84% gain, 2 shares = ₹18.6 gain. Selling would leave -₹3.4 after fees. Not worth selling.\n\n3. **HDFCBANK**: +0.42% gain, 3 shares = ₹12.24 gain. Selling would leave -₹9.76 after fees. Not worth selling.\n\n4. **ONGC**: +0.61% gain, 19 shares = ₹26.98 gain. Selling would leave ₹4.98 after fees. Marginally profitable but very thin margin.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven the transaction costs of ₹22 per sell and the relatively small gains on all positions, it's not profitable to sell any positions today. The best course of action is to hold all positions and wait for larger price movements that would justify the transaction costs.\n\n**Portfolio Allocation Analysis:**\n- Banking stocks (HDFCBANK, KOTAKBANK, AXISBANK): ~59.5% of portfolio\n- Oil & Gas (ONGC): ~37% of portfolio  \n- Cash: ~3.5% of portfolio\n\nThe portfolio is heavily weighted towards banking stocks, which could be risky if there's negative news in the banking sector. However, with limited cash (₹425.68), I cannot diversify significantly.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n1. Hold all current positions\n2. Monitor for larger price movements that would justify selling (minimum 2-3% gains to cover transaction costs)\n3. Consider accumulating more cash for future opportunities\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
