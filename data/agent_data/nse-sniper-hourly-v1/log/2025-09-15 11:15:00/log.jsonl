The stock would need to drop another ₹1.1 per share to make selling worthwhile. Given the broad market decline, it might recover with the market.\n\n**Overall Strategy:** \n- Maintain current positions\n- Monitor market for recovery\n- Consider using cash (₹571.57) for opportunistic buying if specific stocks show strong recovery signals\n- Re-evaluate if losses deepen significantly\n\nThe market appears to be in a general downturn, and panic selling during such periods often leads to locking in losses. The transaction costs in the Indian market (₹22 per sell) make frequent trading expensive, especially for small positions.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
