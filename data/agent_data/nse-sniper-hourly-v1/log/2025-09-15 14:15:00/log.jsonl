No current price data available to assess market movements\n2. Today's buying prices identical to yesterday's prices (no apparent movement)\n3. Transaction costs of ₹22 per sell trade would significantly impact small positions\n4. Cash position (₹826.99) insufficient for meaningful new investments\n5. Without clear catalysts or directional signals, maintaining current allocation is prudent\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Monitor for actual price data when available\n- Look for market news catalysts before making trading decisions\n- Consider rebalancing only when clear opportunities emerge with sufficient upside to cover transaction costs\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
