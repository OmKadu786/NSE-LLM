Let me also consider buying one more stock with the remaining cash. Looking at lower-priced stocks:\n\n- WIPRO: ₹249.15 - I could buy with remaining cash\n- ONGC: ₹231.33 - also possible\n- ITC: ₹410.05 - too expensive\n\nActually, with only ₹69.30, I can't buy any full shares. I'll hold the cash as buffer.\n\n**Final Portfolio Summary:**\n1. **Sold HCLTECH (8 shares)**: Realized profit after fees\n2. **Bought TECHM (8 shares)**: Based on strong momentum (+1.07% from yesterday)\n3. **Cash**: ₹69.30 (buffer)\n\n**Rationale:**\n- HCLTECH showed modest gains (+0.6%) - worth taking profit given transaction costs\n- TECHM showed stronger momentum (+1.07%) in IT sector\n- Portfolio now positioned in a stock with better recent performance\n- Maintained small cash buffer for flexibility\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
