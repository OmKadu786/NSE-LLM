Let me calculate if selling makes sense:\n\n**M&M Potential Profit:**\n- Current price: ₹3,536.15\n- Yesterday's price (assumed purchase price): ₹3,529.65\n- Gross profit: ₹6.50\n- After ₹22 fees: Loss of ₹15.50\n\n**EICHERMOT Performance:**\n- Current price: ₹6,514.75  \n- Yesterday's price: ₹6,519.50\n- Gross loss: ₹4.75\n- After ₹22 fees: Loss of ₹26.75\n\n**Decision Making:**\n1. **M&M**: Not profitable to sell (would lose ₹15.50 after fees)\n2. **EICHERMOT**: Not profitable to sell (would lose ₹26.75 after fees)\n3. **Cash position**: Only ₹1,615.02 available - insufficient for meaningful new purchases\n\n**Market Context from Provided Data:**\nLooking at today's buying prices vs yesterday's:\n- **Top gainers**: BRITANNIA (+₹19.5), LTIM (+₹29.5), NESTLEIND (+₹6.55), SHREECEM (+₹185)\n- **Top losers**: ASIANPAINT (-₹11.05), HEROMOTOCO (-₹22.5), APOLLOHOSP (-₹3), DIVISLAB (-₹18.75)\n\n**Recommendation:**\nGiven the small position sizes and transaction costs, it's not profitable to sell either holding. The minimal gains/losses don't justify the ₹22 exit fee. \n\n**Action Plan:**\n1. Hold current positions (M&M and EICHERMOT)\n2. Monitor for better opportunities\n3. Consider accumulating more cash before making new purchases\n4. Look for stocks with stronger momentum that can overcome transaction costs\n\n**Final Portfolio Status:**\n- M&M: 1 share (hold)\n- EICHERMOT: 1 share (hold)  \n- CASH: ₹1,615.02 (insufficient for meaningful new investment)\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
