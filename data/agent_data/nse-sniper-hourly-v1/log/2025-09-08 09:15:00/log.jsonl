Transaction costs are significant relative to position sizes\n2. Both positions show minimal movement\n3. Cash position is limited for new investments\n\n**Recommendation:**\nGiven the small position sizes and the ₹22 transaction fee, it's not worthwhile to sell either position for such minimal gains/losses. The better strategy would be to:\n1. Hold current positions\n2. Look for opportunities to add to positions when cash allows\n3. Consider selling only if significant news or price movement occurs\n\n**Action Plan:**\nSince the positions are too small to justify transaction costs, I'll hold both positions and monitor for better opportunities.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
