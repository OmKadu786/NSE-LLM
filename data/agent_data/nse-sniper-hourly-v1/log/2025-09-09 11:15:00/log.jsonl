The Indian market appears to be experiencing some profit-taking or minor correction.\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\n1. Both positions are at a loss, and selling would incur ₹22 transaction fees per stock, making the losses worse.\n2. The positions are relatively small, so holding through minor volatility is reasonable.\n3. Without specific negative news about M&M or DRREDDY, holding is the prudent strategy.\n4. Cash position is minimal (₹744.80), so no buying opportunities exist without selling first.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **HOLD** both M&M and DRREDDY positions\n- Monitor for recovery opportunities\n- Consider selling only if positions show significant recovery or if negative company-specific news emerges\n- No new trades recommended given limited cash and current market conditions\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
