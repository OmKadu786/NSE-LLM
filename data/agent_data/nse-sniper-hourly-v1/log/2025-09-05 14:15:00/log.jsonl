Let me analyze my current positions based on yesterday's prices and today's buying prices:\n\n**Current Positions Analysis:**\n1. **M&M**: 1 share, yesterday's price: ₹3,536.15\n2. **EICHERMOT**: 1 share, yesterday's price: ₹6,514.75  \n3. **CASH**: ₹1,615.02\n\n**Today's Buying Prices (same as yesterday's):**\n- M&M: ₹3,536.15\n- EICHERMOT: ₹6,514.75\n\n**Portfolio Value Analysis:**\n- M&M value: ₹3,536.15\n- EICHERMOT value: ₹6,514.75\n- Cash: ₹1,615.02\n- **Total Portfolio Value**: ₹11,665.92\n\n**Transaction Cost Consideration:**\nEvery sell transaction incurs ₹22 in fees.

The transaction costs of ₹22 per sell would eat into any small potential gains, and without current market data showing clear selling signals, holding is the prudent strategy.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
