{"signature": "nse-sniper-hourly-v1", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "BPCL moved from ₹313.95 to ₹315.5 (+₹1.55, +0.49%). Not very exciting. Let me check ITC's movement: ₹410.05 → ₹411.0 (+₹0.95, +0.23%).\n\nActually, let me be more strategic. With INFY already showing +5.39% today, I should be cautious about adding more positions. The remaining cash of ₹1,481.54 is better kept as cash for future opportunities or to average down if INFY pulls back.\n\n**Final Portfolio Analysis:**\n1. **INFY:** 7 shares × ₹1510.1 = ₹10,570.70\n2. **Cash:** ₹1,481.54\n3. **Total Portfolio:** ₹12,052.24\n\n**Trade Rationale:**\n1. Sold TECHM (+0.32%) to capture small gain\n2. Bought INFY (+5.39%) to ride strong momentum\n3. Transaction cost of ₹22 justified by INFY's significant outperformance potential\n4. Kept cash reserve for future opportunities or averaging down\n\n**Risk Management:**\n- INFY's large move could mean it's overbought, but the momentum suggests continued strength\n- Cash reserve provides flexibility\n- Single position concentration risk, but justified by strong catalyst\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
