BAJAJ-AUTO: ₹9,102 → ₹9,490 (+4.26%)\n2. EICHERMOT: ₹6,570.5 → ₹6,848 (+4.22%)\n3. M&M: ₹3,585 → ₹3,715.2 (+3.63%)\n4. JSWSTEEL: ₹1,080.1 → ₹1,112.3 (+2.98%)\n5. TATAMOTORS: ₹695 → ₹722 (+3.88%)\n\n**Decision Making:**\n\n**Current Holdings Assessment:**\n1. **M&M**: Up 3.63%, net profit after fees would be ₹108.2. This is a decent gain, but given the positive momentum in auto stocks, I should consider holding for potentially higher gains.\n\n2. **EICHERMOT**: Up 4.22%, net profit after fees would be ₹255.5. Strong performance, but also in the auto sector which is showing strength.\n\n**Market Context:**\n- Auto sector appears strong (BAJAJ-AUTO, EICHERMOT, M&M, TATAMOTORS all up significantly)\n- Limited cash available for new positions (₹1,615)\n- Transaction costs make small trades less profitable\n\n**Recommendation:**\nGiven the strong performance of our current holdings and the positive momentum in the auto sector, I recommend:\n1. **HOLD both M&M and EICHERMOT** - Both are showing strong gains and sector momentum suggests potential for further upside\n2. **Monitor for exit signals** - Consider selling if gains reach 5%+ or if sector momentum reverses\n3. **Consider adding to positions** if more cash becomes available, but current cash is insufficient for meaningful new positions\n\n**Risk Considerations:**\n- Auto sector could be volatile\n- Market may be overbought in the short term\n- Transaction costs make frequent trading expensive\n\n**Final Portfolio Status:**\n- M&M: 1 share @ ₹3,715.2 (+3.63%)\n- EICHERMOT: 1 share @ ₹6,848 (+4.22%)\n- Cash: ₹1,615.02\n- Total Portfolio: ₹12,178.22\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
