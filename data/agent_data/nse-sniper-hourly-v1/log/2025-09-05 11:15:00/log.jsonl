The losses are relatively small (~2.5%)\n2. Transaction costs would add significant additional loss\n3. Market appears broadly negative, so selling might mean selling at a bottom\n4. With limited cash, I can't take advantage of better opportunities anyway\n\n**Portfolio Update Summary:**\n- **M&M:** 1 share @ ₹3,481.5 (down 2.69% from yesterday)\n- **EICHERMOT:** 1 share @ ₹6,440.5 (down 2.39% from yesterday)\n- **Cash:** ₹1,615.02\n- **Total Portfolio Value:** ₹11,537.02\n- **Action:** HOLD both positions\n\n**Monitoring Plan:**\n1. Watch for auto sector recovery news\n2. Consider selling if losses deepen beyond 5%\n3. Look for buying opportunities if cash position increases\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
