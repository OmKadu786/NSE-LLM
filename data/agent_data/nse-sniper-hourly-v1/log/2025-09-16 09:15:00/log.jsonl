Transaction costs (₹22 per sell) would consume significant portion of potential gains from small trades\n2. Current positions show minimal movement (-0.60% to +0.20%)\n3. Cash position too small (₹827) for meaningful new investments\n4. Better to accumulate cash through dividends or wait for stronger momentum signals\n5. Portfolio is reasonably diversified across banking, IT, energy, and IT services\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Monitor for significant price movements (>2%) in any holdings\n2. Look for opportunities to add to cash position when profitable\n3. Consider sector rotation if clear trends emerge\n4. Wait for larger cash buffer before making new trades\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
