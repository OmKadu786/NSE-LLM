This was a profitable trade.\n2. **Held HDFCBANK**: Only had ₹18.3 gain, which would result in a net loss after ₹22 fees.\n3. **Bought AXISBANK**: Showed strong momentum with 0.90% gain, which is better than many other banking stocks. With 8 shares, if it continues to rise, I could capture significant gains.\n\nThe remaining cash of ₹659.87 is too small to make meaningful additional purchases, so I'll hold it for future opportunities.\n\n**Portfolio Summary as of 2025-09-10 12:15:00:**\n- HDFCBANK: 3 shares @ ₹967.8 = ₹2,903.40\n- AXISBANK: 8 shares @ ₹1,064.6 = ₹8,516.80  \n- Cash: ₹659.87\n- **Total Portfolio Value: ₹12,080.07**\n\n**Trading Rationale:**\n- Executed one profitable trade (INFY sale with net gain after fees)\n- Maintained position in HDFCBANK as selling would be unprofitable due to transaction costs\n- Rotated into AXISBANK which showed stronger momentum (0.90% gain vs HDFCBANK's 0.63%)\n- Transaction costs in Indian market (₹22 per sell) significantly impact small trades\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
