Transaction costs of ₹22 per sell trade would turn small gains into losses\n2. No position shows sufficient momentum (>1% gain) to justify profit-taking\n3. Cash position is too small for meaningful new investments\n4. Portfolio is reasonably diversified across sectors\n5. Market movements are minimal today, suggesting a wait-and-watch approach\n\n**Action Plan:**\n1. Monitor for RBI policy updates or sector-specific news\n2. Consider profit booking if any position gains >1.5% (to cover fees + profit)\n3. Build cash reserves for future opportunities\n4. Re-evaluate if market volatility increases or significant news emerges\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
