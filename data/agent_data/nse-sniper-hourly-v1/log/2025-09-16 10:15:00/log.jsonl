Let me review my updated portfolio:\n\n**Final Portfolio (as of 2025-09-16 10:15:00):**\n1. **HDFCBANK**: 3 shares @ ₹969.35 = ₹2,908.05\n2. **ONGC**: 19 shares @ ₹235.27 = ₹4,470.13\n3. **KOTAKBANK**: 1 share @ ₹2,030.5 = ₹2,030.50\n4. **AXISBANK**: 2 shares @ ₹1,123.0 = ₹2,246.00\n5. **CASH**: ₹425.68\n\n**Total Portfolio Value**: ₹2,908.05 + ₹4,470.13 + ₹2,030.50 + ₹2,246.00 + ₹425.68 = ₹12,080.36\n\n**Trades Executed:**\n1.

Bought 2 AXISBANK @ ₹1,123.0 = ₹2,246.00 (up 1.68% from yesterday)\n\n**Portfolio Strategy:**\n- Increased exposure to banking sector (HDFCBANK, KOTAKBANK, AXISBANK)\n- Consolidated energy position (ONGC from 10 to 19 shares)\n- Exited IT sector positions (HCLTECH, TECHM) to lock in profits\n- Maintained small cash buffer for future opportunities\n\n**Rationale:**\n1. Banking stocks showing strength (KOTAKBANK +2.74%, AXISBANK +1.68%)\n2. Energy sector performing well (ONGC +1.20%)\n3. IT sector profits were marginal after transaction costs\n4. Portfolio now focused on sectors showing strongest momentum\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
