Clear fundamental catalysts (RBI policy, earnings surprises, sector-specific news)\n2. Price movements >3% indicating trend changes\n3. Stocks where potential upside significantly outweighs the ₹22 exit fee\n\nThe market appears relatively flat today with minimal movements. Better to preserve capital than make marginal trades that would be consumed by fixed DP charges and STT.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
