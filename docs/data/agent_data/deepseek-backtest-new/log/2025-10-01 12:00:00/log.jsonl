Bought 1 share of XEL (Xcel Energy) - adding utilities exposure\n\n**Updated Portfolio Composition:**\n- Tech stocks: NVDA, MSFT, AAPL (reduced), GOOGL, AMZN, AMD\n- Healthcare: AZN (new)\n- Consumer Staples: PEP (new)\n- Utilities: XEL (new)\n- Cash: $1.44 (minimal)\n\n**Benefits of this rebalancing:**\n1. Reduced tech concentration from ~98.5% to ~95%\n2. Added diversification across healthcare, consumer staples, and utilities sectors\n3.
