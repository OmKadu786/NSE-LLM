The key changes I've made:\n\n1. **Reduced tech concentration**: Sold MSFT completely and reduced NVDA from 8 to 2 shares\n2. **Added defensive positions**: \n   - COST (consumer staples)\n   - AEP (utilities) \n   - SBUX (consumer discretionary but defensive)\n   - Increased XEL (utilities)\n3. **Maintained core tech positions**: Still have AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN, AMD but at reduced weights\n4. **Kept healthcare exposure**: GILD, AMGN, BIIB, AZN\n5. **Maintained some consumer staples**: PEP, KHC (reduced), MDLZ (reduced)\n\nThe portfolio is now better diversified across sectors:\n- Technology: AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN, AMD, NVDA\n- Healthcare: GILD, AMGN, BIIB, AZN  \n- Consumer Staples: COST, PEP, KHC, MDLZ\n- Utilities: AEP, XEL\n- Consumer Discretionary: SBUX\n- Industrials: HON\n\nThis provides better risk management while still maintaining exposure to growth sectors. The cash position of $55.77 provides some flexibility for future opportunities.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
