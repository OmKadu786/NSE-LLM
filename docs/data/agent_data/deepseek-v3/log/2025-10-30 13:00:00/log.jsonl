This is a reasonable amount of cash to keep for flexibility.\n\nLet me summarize the changes I made:\n\n1. **Sold 1 share of NVDA** - Reduced technology concentration\n2. **Sold 1 share of AMD** - Reduced technology concentration  \n3. **Bought 1 share of GILD** - Added healthcare diversification\n4. **Bought 1 share of GEHC** - Added healthcare/industrial diversification\n5. **Bought 1 share of KHC** - Added consumer staples diversification\n6. **Bought 1 share of AEP** - Added utilities diversification\n7. **Bought 1 share of PAYX** - Added financial services diversification\n\nThe portfolio is now more diversified across sectors:\n- Technology: Still significant but reduced (NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN, META, AVGO, TSLA, AMD)\n- Healthcare: AMGN, REGN, GILD, GEHC (increased exposure)\n- Consumer: COST, PEP, KHC (increased staples)\n- Industrial: HON\n- Utilities: XEL, AEP (increased exposure)\n- Financial: PAYX (new exposure)\n\nThis rebalancing reduces concentration risk in technology while adding defensive sectors (healthcare, consumer staples, utilities) that tend to be more stable during market downturns. The remaining cash provides flexibility for future opportunities.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
