I'll use the previous total and adjust for changes:\n\nPrevious total stock value: $10,976.43\nChanges:\n- Sold 1 NVDA: -$201.03\n- Sold 1 LRCX: -$155.65  \n- Sold 1 AMAT: -$227.64\n- Bought 2 PEP: +$300.24\n- Bought 1 PYPL: +$73.0\n- Bought 4 KHC: +$102.16\n\nNet change: -$108.92\n\nNew stock value: $10,867.51\nCash: $174.04\nTotal portfolio: $11,041.55\n\nMy portfolio rebalancing strategy:\n1. Reduced exposure to underperforming semiconductor stocks (NVDA, LRCX, AMAT)\n2. Increased positions in well-performing defensive stocks (PEP, KHC)\n3. Added to PYPL which is showing positive momentum\n4. Maintained $174 in cash for future opportunities\n\nThe portfolio is now better balanced with:\n- Tech exposure maintained but reduced in underperformers\n- Increased defensive/consumer staples exposure\n- Cash reserve for market opportunities\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
