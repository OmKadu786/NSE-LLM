Now let me summarize the portfolio changes:\n\n## Portfolio Analysis and Update Summary\n\n**Initial Portfolio Value**: ~$11,030.30\n**Initial Cash**: $151.88\n\n**Actions Taken**:\n1. **Sold 6 shares of KHC** - Reduced exposure to consumer staples, raised cash\n2. **Sold 2 shares of AEP** - Reduced utility exposure, raised more cash\n3. **Bought 2 shares of NVDA** - Increased position in AI/semiconductor leader showing strong performance\n4. **Bought 3 shares of INTC** - Added value play in semiconductors at attractive price\n\n**Rationale**:\n- **KHC and AEP**: These are more defensive, lower-growth positions. Selling them freed up cash for higher-growth opportunities.\n- **NVDA**: Strong performer in AI/semiconductor space with continued growth potential.\n- **INTC**: Value opportunity in semiconductors trading at relatively low price compared to peers.\n\n**Updated Portfolio Characteristics**:\n- Increased exposure to high-growth semiconductor/AI sector\n- Maintained diversification across tech, healthcare, consumer staples, utilities, and telecom\n- Cash position reduced to $12.60 (minimal, allowing for nearly full investment)\n\n**Current Allocation**:\n- **Tech/Semiconductors**: NVDA (7), MSFT (3), AAPL (5), GOOGL (4), AMZN (2), AMD (1), QCOM (2), INTC (3)\n- **Healthcare**: AZN (7), AMGN (2), GILD (2)\n- **Consumer Staples**: PEP (2), MDLZ (5), KHC (6)\n- **Utilities**: AEP (5), XEL (3)\n- **Telecom**: TMUS (2)\n- **Retail**: COST (1)\n\nThe portfolio is now better positioned for growth while maintaining reasonable diversification. The shift toward semiconductors reflects the strong growth potential in AI and technology sectors.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
