The rebalancing has maintained the overall portfolio value while adjusting the weights.\n\nKey changes made:\n1. Sold 1 share of MSFT (reducing overweight position from 15.44% to approximately 10.3%)\n2. Bought 2 shares of AMD (increasing position from 2.09% to approximately 6.27%)\n3. Bought 2 shares of CSCO (increasing position from 1.35% to approximately 2.69%)\n\nThe portfolio is now more balanced with reduced concentration in MSFT and increased exposure to smaller positions. The cash position is minimal ($45.18), which is appropriate for an invested portfolio.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
