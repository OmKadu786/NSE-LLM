Reduced PEP from 4 to 2 shares (sold 2)  \n3. Reduced XEL from 2 to 1 share (sold 1)\n4. Added 1 share of META at $749.91\n5. Added 1 share of ASML at $1051.567\n\nThese changes help diversify the portfolio while maintaining exposure to growth sectors. META adds social media/digital advertising exposure, and ASML adds semiconductor equipment manufacturing exposure, complementing the existing chip stocks (NVDA, AMD, QCOM).\n\nThe portfolio now has a better balance with reduced concentration in underperforming positions and added exposure to strong performers in different tech sub-sectors.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
