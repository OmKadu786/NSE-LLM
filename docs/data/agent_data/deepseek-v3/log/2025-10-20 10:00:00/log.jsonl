Now let me summarize the portfolio rebalancing I've done:\n\n## Portfolio Analysis and Rebalancing Summary\n\n**Initial Portfolio Value:** ~$10,326.21\n**Current Cash:** $12.34\n\n### Actions Taken:\n\n1. **Sold Underperformers:**\n   - Sold 2 shares of AAPL (down 2.59%)\n   - Sold 1 share of META (down 1.73%)\n   - Sold 1 share of GOOGL (down 0.70%)\n\n2. **Added to Winners/Opportunities:**\n   - Bought 2 additional shares of NVDA (up 0.16%)\n   - Bought 1 share of COST (defensive consumer staple, down only 0.08%)\n   - Bought 5 shares of INTC (value play in semiconductors, down 2.73%)\n\n### Portfolio Strategy:\n- **Increased exposure to semiconductors** (NVDA, INTC) which are key growth areas\n- **Added defensive position** with COST (consumer staples tend to be more stable)\n- **Reduced exposure to underperforming tech stocks** (AAPL, META, GOOGL)\n- **Maintained positions** in other solid holdings (MSFT, AMZN, AMD, etc.)\n\n### Current Portfolio Composition:\n- **Technology/Semiconductors:** NVDA (6), MSFT (2), AMD (4), CSCO (4), INTC (5), AMAT (2), LRCX (2), QCOM (2), AVGO (1)\n- **Consumer/Retail:** AAPL (2), AMZN (3), COST (1), SBUX (1), KDP (10), KHC (1), PEP (5)\n- **Industrial:** HON (4)\n- **Communications:** CMCSA (10), GOOGL (2)\n- **Healthcare:** AMGN (2)\n\nThe portfolio is now better positioned with:\n1. Stronger semiconductor exposure (NVDA, INTC)\n2. Defensive consumer staple (COST)\n3. Reduced concentration in underperforming tech names\n4. Maintained diversification across sectors\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
